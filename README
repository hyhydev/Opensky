# The Challenge

https://openskynetwork.github.io/opensky-api/rest.html

Using the above API, create a RESTful API in NodeJS that does the following:

Given parameters of airport, type (arrival / departure), start date and end date; return a list of aircraft with the following normalised data:

-   ICAO24 of the aircraft.
-   Departure airport.
-   Arrival airport.
-   Callsign of the aircraft.
-   When it was first seen.
-   When it was last seen.

## General Requirements

-   Properly structured project.
-   Connection to a database, normalising and caching the results from the external API. The application will then return results from the database.
-   Use an ORM framework for the database connection.
-   Evidence of unit tests.
-   Evidence of integration tests.
-   Exception handling and error failover.
-   Correct use of HTTP response codes.
-   Swagger style comments.

## Timeline

2 days. Code to be provided by 17:30 on Tues.
